A centralized repository of reusable automation scripts, utilities, and templates designed to streamline common tasks and workflows.
This collection serves as our go-to library for future projects, containing battle-tested scripts that can be quickly deployed or adapted for new requirements.

Usage: 
Before creating new automation from scratch, check this library first to see if a suitable script already exists or can be modified to meet your needs. 
All scripts should be well-documented with clear usage instructions and examples.
